               This is a story of how men discover who they are within their deepest fantasies of wealth, luxury and exclusivity.  This reflection requires a man who wears best in class fabrics that fit him like the personality he was born with. He is distinguished as the one and only and thus wears this mantra in the fabrics he chooses. Like the mountains he stands magnificent through the highs and lows of life with his peak unique only to him. This is the story of Primo, "IL Solo Ed Unico."
               This will be the story of you.
